e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a tool used for version control, allowing you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others locally on your computer. GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories online, enabling you to share, collaborate on, and manage projects with others.

In short, Git is the version control system, and GitHub is a platform that makes using Git easier for collaboration and sharing.

-------------------------
f. What does git diff do?
git diff shows the changes between different versions of your files. It helps you see what has been modified in your working directory or between commits.

-----------------------
g. What is the main branch?
The main branch is the primary branch in a Git repository where the production-ready code is typically maintained. It is often the default branch where the final, stable version of the code resides and is used as the base for other branches.

------------------------------
h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
It's best not to push directly to the main branch. Instead, use feature branches for your changes and merge them into the main branch after review and testing. This helps keep your main branch stable and organized.
